Sample code for a book (Delphi XE2 Foundations) plus some other stuff people may find useful - an FMX TClipboard, a TCustomIniFile descendant that wraps the Mac Preferences API, and a simple wrapper for creating a PDF on OS X by drawing to a FireMonkey TCanvas. All require XE2 or greater, and the Delphi compiler and RTL (FPC not supported).

Unfortunately, the XE3 IDE's Subversion integration is incompatible with Google Code's (XE2's is fine). If you have bought the book and using XE3, a quick way to download the sample code is therefore to get the ZIP [here](http://code.google.com/p/delphi-foundations/downloads/list).
